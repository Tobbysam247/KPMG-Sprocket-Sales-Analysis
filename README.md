## 📍 Setting the Stage: Who Are Our Customers?

![Customer Segmentation Dashboard](Sprocket%20Sales%20Analysis%201.png)

We began our journey by looking closely at **who is buying** and **what defines them**.  

- Car ownership emerged as a subtle but powerful differentiator. Customers aged **36–50**, with access to cars, made up the largest and most profitable segment.
- The Standard product line was the clear favourite, accounting for **$142M** in sales—far outpacing other categories.
- When we looked at brand performance, WeareA2B and Solex led the pack in profit, suggesting a loyal customer base and pricing power.
- Regionally, New South Wales stood out not just in volume but in profitability—generating over $5.9M in profit alone.

> **Strategy Insight**: Focus on middle-aged, car-owning customers in high-performing regions like New South Wales. Use this base to expand reach into similar profiles within untapped states.

## 📈 Product and Brand Performance: What’s Selling & When?

Next, we shifted our lens to **product demand and seasonal performance**.

- Sales spiked in October, hinting at a strong Q4 buying behaviour, perhaps driven by promotions or weather cycles.
- Across all quarters, Q4 topped with $2.85M in profit, reinforcing the seasonal pattern.
- Medium-sized bikes hit the sweet spot: they sold the most (13,000 units) and delivered the highest profit ($6.9M).
- A deep dive into job categories revealed that customers in Manufacturing and Financial Services contributed the most in both sales and profit.

> **Strategy Insight**: Prepare inventory and campaigns ahead of Q4. Double down on medium-sized products, and explore why specific job segments are more valuable—tailoring offers accordingly.

## Recommendations

Based on the insights across the dashboards, here are **data-driven strategies** to improve outcomes:

1. **Customer Targeting**  
   Focus on high-value segments: car owners aged 36–50, professionals in manufacturing and finance, affluent buyers.

2. **Product Strategy**  
   Standard and medium-sized bikes should lead inventory planning and promotions.

3. **Regional Focus**  
   New South Wales and Queensland show strong potential. Expand targeted campaigns in these regions using localized offers.

4. **Digital Push**  
   Encourage more online orders. Many current buyers still purchase offline—this is a growth opportunity.
